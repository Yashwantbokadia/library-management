A Library Management System with PHP, HTML,CSS and MySQL
###Purpose of the project
A Library Management System with PHP and MySQL. 
The project entitled “Integrated Library System” is proposed to automate/transform the existing traditional city library into automated computerized online library which will share a common database to perform all the basic functions of a library i.e. this system will keep records related to book search history, book issue status, book return status, fine collection, new book request, availability of books in a secured database. Same way members' details like name, login ID, book issued, book requested etc are updated to database so there will be no chance of loss of information.
There is a library where all operations are managed manually in the form of physical files and registers.
In this method it is not easy to know exact details of availability of books and location of books in the library because of manual search. Managing information about issue/return of the books is also not efficient in the existing system. There is no central database for future reference.
Because of the above drawbacks of existing system, “Integrated Library System” is proposed which will perform tasks such as receiving subscriptions from members, adding members, recording of member’s data, subscription to magazines and newspapers, assigning shelves to books, issuing details, books returning details etc.
